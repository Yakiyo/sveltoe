# Sveltoe: tic-tac-toe in svelte
This is a recreation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game tutorial from [react docs](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). I did it for fun and it was nice using svelte. Couldn't really bother implementing the "Time Travel" feature, but everything else is done. It was far more easier to do it in svelte than react for me. Less complexity since im [Grug Brained](https://grugbrain.dev/).

Cheers!
